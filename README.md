# genetic_algorithem_Best_EMA

The idea behind this is EMA is the most common used indicator so if we can find the best EMA We might(?) be able to use those 2 EMAs for maximum profit



in this note book I use genetic algorithem in BTC price 2 years (2019 and 2020) to find best EMAs 
(in my case it is EMA10 and EMA31)

and use those EMA to trade in 2021

The result is not good my EMA underperform BTC price in 2021
